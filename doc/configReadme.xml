To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (Siebel) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

		<![CDATA[
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Product Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X / 200**

Being X the number of Products to be synchronized on each run.

The division by 200 is because, by default, Users are gathered in groups
of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider
that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 1 api
calls to SFDC will be made ( 1).
