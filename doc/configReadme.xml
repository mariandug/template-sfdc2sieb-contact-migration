I want to synchronize accounts from Salesforce to Siebel.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating contacts from Salesforce to Siebel, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behavior when an contact already exists in the Siebel. 

As implemented, this Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Template will go to the Salesforce and query all the existing Contacts that match the filter criteria.
During the Process stage, each Salesforce Contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching Contact in the Siebel and if the last updated date of the later is greater than the one of Salesforce.
The last step of the Process stage will group the contacts and create them in Siebel.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (Salesforce) and destination (Siebel) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Product Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X / 200**

Being X the number of Products to be synchronized on each run.

The division by 200 is because, by default, Users are gathered in groups
of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider
that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 1 api
calls to SFDC will be made ( 1).

		<![CDATA[This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migratecontacts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Contacts synced and filtered by the criteria specified.
